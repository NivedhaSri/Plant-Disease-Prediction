# Plant-Disease-Prediction
The dataset is taken from kaggle . The link is given below https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease

The main idea of this project is to help the farmers to identify the type of disease in tomato plant by creating a model using CNN that can predict the type of disease in tomato plant. This dataset has 10 labels and a total of 16011 images. I have splited the dataset into train , test and validation to feed into the model. Training - 80% of the data. Testing - 10% of the data. Validation - 10% of the data. I have rescaled the data and augmented the data and converted to gray scale to get a good accuracy of the model.
